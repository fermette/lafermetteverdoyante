## Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 2026**

This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) aims to formalize our commitment to respecting the privacy of users of the website “lafermetteverdoyante.com” (the “Site”) operated by the association La Fermette Verdoyante.

The Policy and the Site's Terms and Conditions form a contractual agreement.

In providing our Site, we process your personal data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 (“GDPR”) and under the conditions set out below.

Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. We collect and process personal data solely for the purpose of providing our Services or communicating about these Services, in strict compliance with the GDPR. We only collect personal data that is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. Therefore, you will never be asked to provide personal data considered "sensitive," such as your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or philosophical or religious beliefs.

By registering on the Site, you authorize us to process your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using the Site and the Services.

## When do we collect your personal data and what data is collected?

We may collect and store your personal data, particularly when you:

• browse the Site

We use your personal data to enable the implementation and management of the Site's Services and to respond to your specific requests. We also use your personal data to operate and improve our Services, our Site, and our approach. This information is used solely by us and allows us to better tailor our services to your needs.

We will use your data to send you an email newsletter about our association's communications, which you can subscribe to if you wish. We will then use the personal data you provided when you registered. You can unsubscribe from these emails at any time.

Connection data. Each time you connect to our Site, we collect personal data such as, in particular, your IP address and your computer's MAC address, the date and time of connection, as well as information about the browser you are using.

Browsing data. We also collect information that identifies how you access the Site, which pages you visit, and for how long. In this context, we may use cookies as described in section 6 below.

### Subscribing to our future Newsletter

You can directly consent to receiving our newsletters by entering your email address in the designated areas on the Site.

In any case, you have the right to withdraw your consent to receive such newsletters at any time and free of charge, under the conditions set out in section 6 of this Privacy Policy.

### Contact Information

To respond to any requests you may make to our organization and to confirm your information, we may use your first and last name(s), email address(es), and telephone number(s).

## How do we protect your personal data?

We have implemented technical and organizational security measures to guarantee the security, integrity, and confidentiality of all your personal data, preventing it from being altered, damaged, or accessed by unauthorized third parties. We ensure an appropriate level of security, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks and their likelihood.

However, it should be noted that since no security measure is infallible, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal data.

## In what cases do we share your personal data?

### Sharing your personal data with third-party companies

When you browse the Site, your personal data may be transmitted to external service providers. These third parties provide services on our behalf and in our name to ensure the proper functioning of credit card payments and other Services.

Personal data may be transferred to countries outside the European Union (such as the United States) via third-party processing services like Google, particularly for website indexing purposes.

Other transfers of personal data to the United States are governed by the EU-US Privacy Shield: [**click here for more information**](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/le-privacy-shield).

Unless a third party asks you to accept its own privacy policy and terms of use, third-party companies that have received your personal data have committed to processing it solely for the provision of our Services. We will never share your personal data with third-party companies for marketing and/or commercial purposes without your prior consent.

### Sharing with the authorities

We may be required to disclose your personal data to administrative or judicial authorities when such disclosure is necessary to identify, apprehend, or prosecute any individual likely to infringe upon our rights, the rights of any other user, or the rights of a third party. We may also be legally obligated to disclose your personal data, and in such cases, we cannot object.

## How long do we keep your personal data?

We will only keep your personal data if you wish to become a member of the association and solely for communication purposes related to the association's activities.

Therefore, all personal data obtained through anonymous statistical analysis using the open-source software Matomo will be automatically deleted. It will be processed in accordance with the uses described in this Charter and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
